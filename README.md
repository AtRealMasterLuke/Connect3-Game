# Connect3-Game
Connect3 is an Android-based game inspired by the classic tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) game. This project is built to practice and sharpen Android development skills. The game allows two players to compete by taking turns to place their pieces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a winning pattern.
# Introduction
Connect3 is a two-player turn-based strategy game where each player aims to align their colored pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win. The game utilizes simple animations for piece placement and resets for a seamless user experience.
# Game Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their piece on an empty cell.
3. The first player to align three of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. If all nine cells are filled without any player aligning three pieces, the game is declared a draw.
# Current Features
- Grid Layout: Simple 3x3 game grid layout using GridLayout.
- Player Turns: Alternating turns between two players (Green and Blue).
- Animations: Smooth animations when a piece is placed on the grid.
- Winner Detection: Automatic detection of win conditions with a winning message.
